              <p class="description">The first thing we see on this site is this invitation, 
                  you can feel that the company is interested in you becoming 
                  a member to have a better experience on their site, their 
                  intention is to draw your attention to this part, that's why 
                  they made the Join today button prominent by using red color.

              <p>On this site the types of news are grouped close to each other, 
                  for example in the Latest section or the Featured section we can
                   see how these elements of the page are grouped, there is little 
                   space between them, in this way the site makes us understand that 
                   these elements have a relationship.

              <p class="description">In different sections of the site the background color is a bit 
                  different and in each section there is a good contrast in the colors
                   of the text and the background, which makes the text easy to read 
                   and also blends in with other content.</p>
